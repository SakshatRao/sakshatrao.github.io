As the only Indian and undergraduate team among the finalists, we also got an opportunity to present our insights at the Wharton People Analytics Conference 2021.</h4>
                    <h4>The objective of the competition was to provide actionable recommendations to the 'Teach For America' nonprofit organization. Our eventual findings involved using extensive & creative data analysis & nudge theory to make data-driven suggestions to TFA's applicants. We also proposed an ambitious and innovative Reinforcement Learning model to make optimized offers to the TFA applicants. My own contributions were towards data analytics & visualizations.</h4>

                    <h4>The objective of the challenge was to propose and build an application using the Industry-grade Swadeshi Microprocessor families called Shakti & Vega. Our proposal was called 'Smart Road Traffic Control & Monitoring System'. We proposed using CCTV cameras to dynamically schedule traffic signals based on the real-time traffic at an intersection. Instead of following the pre-determined cyclic sequence of traffic lights, the traffic signals would be able to detect the level of traffic on each road and then decide which traffic lights to change and for how long.</h4>

The menu also makes recommendations to customers based on their order history. To make recommendations, I designed 'ingredient embeddings' which can represent different food items based on taste, origin, type of dish (entree, main course, dessert), etc. I also developed an approach for customers to provide extremely quick feedback by simply clicking a picture of their food and giving a star rating. Based on the picture, my models can identify the food item and accordingly manage the review.</h4>

Essentially, the chatbot can answer customer-specific personal questions by converting the question to an SQL query and then fetching the answer from a database. The chatbot can also help provide customers with real-time updates about the construction to reassure them about the risks of under-construction projects. Using the current progress, it is also capable of forecasting the date of completion using multiple Time Series Forecasting models.</h4>

                    <h4>In this global presentation competition organized by IET, I reached the Local Network Round held in Bengaluru and secured a top 4 position. Participants were needed to present & deliver a presentation based on any technological topic.</h4>
                    <h4>My topic of presentation was 'Future of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare'. My presentation touched upon the fear that machines might replace doctors & nurses in the future. However, my argument was that simply obtaining better performance than doctors cannot be a justification to replace doctors; since emotions and feelings like empathy, human touch & intuition are essential aspects of a doctor's job.</h4>

                    <h4>My topic of presentation was 'Neuromorphic Computing'. My presentation explained the fundamentals of neural networks and software-based training of these networks; and then introduced the concept of Neuromorphic Computing where hardware tries to mimic neurons, thereby eliminating several limitations of conventional software-based training.</h4>
