Due to the Covid19 pandemic, working remotely on the project was tough but fortunately we were able to complete the main functionality & present it virtually.</h4>
                    <h4>The main aim of the project was to develop an IoT-based 'Smart Hospital' environment. We wanted to integrate hardware and software in medical applications which would benefit doctors & nurses. Incorporating different fields of technology, we wanted to build something more valuable than its parts.</h4>

                    </div>
                    <h4>At the center of our project was a web server we created using Django. We also developed a Patient Health Monitoring system which shared patient vitals to the server through MQTT. The vital measurements included Body Temperature, SpO2, Heart Rate & ECG. Our main idea was to embed the different sensors into the patient's hospital gown to help nurses continuously, conveniently & remotely monitor their health. We also included simple thresholds to alert nurses in case of abnormally high or low vitals.</h4>
                    <h4>We developed a website from scratch for patients to check on their health and for nurses & doctors to monitor several patients' health in one glance. We also added a platform for Electronic Health Records for doctors to make digital prescriptions for a patient. Further, we developed an interactive data analytics dashboard using Plotly with statistics like room occupancy, staff gender ratio & patient demographics for the hospital administration to gain insights and help with the decision-making process.</h4>
                    <h4>We also developed an ECG display which can read, process, visualize and analyze a patient's ECG waveform using Digital Signal Processing. We also trained an Multi-layered LSTM to identify abnormalities in the heartbeat pattern. Additionally, we also developed a simple 'Smart Sanitizer' which automatically alerts any individual entering into a patient's room to sanitize their hands. This is a very recommended practice in hopsitals, especially in ICUs & OTs to prevent cross-contamination.</h4>

The main idea of my proposal was to create an online platform where travelers would be able to pre-order food before actually entering a restaurant. This would save the travelers time on their journey and enable the restaurant to improve their service rate. To make the experience more convenient & memorable, I also applied a few Machine Learning models.</h4>
                    <h4>The frontend was developed from scratch using HTML, CSS, a bit of JavaScript and with the help of BootStrap. The web server was developed in Django. Travelers can view the Virtual Menu to look at the price, description, images & even others' feedback about different food items. While ordering, they can apply coupons & after ordering, they stand a chance to win coupons.</h4>
                    <h4>I also added a Quick Feedback option for customers to give extremely convenient feedback about different food items - simply take a picture of the food & add a star rating. The customer does not have to mention the food item for which the rating is being given, since the food item is automatically identified by my ML model using the picture.</h4>

                    <h4>Simulation setting can be made for complex traffic lighting system at intersection. The simulation has realistic features in car movement at intersections, acceleration/deceleration, etc. It also has the capability to spawn emergency vehicles and pedestrian call button triggers at given probability rate. The simulation tool provides total number of cars on a lane, not total number of cars on a lane going in a particular direction, to the scheduler; thus mimicking actual traffic signal cameras.</h4>
                    <h4>Simulation data is recorded over a period of 24 hrs simulation time after which different algorithms can be tested based on unique metrics like avg waiting time, avg emergency vehicle waiting time, traffic lane length, pedestrian waiting time, etc.</h4>

                    <h4>My main idea was to recognize handwritten digits by tracking the pen's motion. Since we can expect the pen to move in the same shape as whatever digit is being written, we can simply track the pen's motion to predict digits without the need for cameras or other visual sensors. Through a simple Tkinter User Interface in Python, this project essentially digitized pen-and-paper writing. I also attached piezo-electric cells underneath the writing surface to ensure digit recognition happens only when the pen is actually writing on the board.</h4>
                    <h4>I also added an extremely simple Dim Lighting Assistance to help write in darkness while also adding another TinyML model for gesture recognition wherein one can customize the cursor position, font color & font size through gestures.</h4>

The main idea was to enable Natural Language to SQL query conversion in the website's chatbot so that the bot can efficiently search the IRIS database for answers. The main steps involved firstly processing the question text, then identifying the general topic of question, then guessing the table in the database which might contain the answer & finally applying a pre-trained NL-to-SQL model like SQLNet to generate an SQL query.</h4>
