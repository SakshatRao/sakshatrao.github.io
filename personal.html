                    <h4>I was introduced to music pretty early in my life. I started learning keyboard when I was maybe around 7 or 8 years old and have been playing it for more than 15 years now. I feel immensely delighted of having had the companionship of my old dusty keyboard for such a long time in my life - though I've transformed from a early primary school kid to an employed mature adult, I still feel equally happy when I sit down to play a song on my keyboard.</h4>
                    <h4>My knowledge in playing keyboard helped me in expanding my instrumental skills in the past few years. I have learned to play guitar decently well and am learning to play saxophone, harmonium and harmonica too. I sometimes wish I had eight hands, just so that I can learn to play complete instrumental songs all by my own. But yeah, I'm still quite happy with the music I can play with my two silly hands.</h4>

                    <h4>Since my schooldays, I have been quite active in sports. I played a lot of the classic gully cricket in Mumbai and participated in few football and athletics school contests. I feel playing sports is a much funner way of staying fit and healthy than gyms or jogs. Football 7-a-sides, friendly leather-ball cricket matches or just playing simple old badminton with my friends - I find these extremely fun and helpful. Having taken part in couple of quarter-marathons, I also want to work towards a half and eventually full marathon run someday.</h4>

                    <h4>I occasionally enjoy writing poems, especially when I feel inspired. I don't really have a schedule for writing poems - rather some days I just think about something that's there in my mind. And after I spend some time converting those thoughts into beautiful rhyming lines, I have myself a nice poem within 2-3 hours. For me, the most essential ingredient of writing poems is not vocabulary knowledge or creativity with words, it is inspiration.</h4>
