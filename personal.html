                    <h4>I have around 15 years of experience playing the keyboard. I enjoy playing songs by ear, for I not only get to enjoy how the song sounds but also how technically brilliant it is. I have experience playing other musical instruments like Guitar, Saxophone, Harmonica & Harmonium, but I still have a lot to learn and practice.</h4>
                    <h4>One of my desires (like many other instrumentalists) is to be a self-sufficient musician - that is, be able to play/record songs all by myself. I realize I need to be very good with different instruments for that, but hey, I have all my life to work towards that!</h4>
                    <h4>I have attempted covering a couple of my favourite songs which I share on my <a class='linkedin_link' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3kobRvpC1clrblptBwjKIA">YouTube channel for multi-instrumental covers</a>. Feel free to take a look at some of my favourite covers.</h4>

                    <h4>I enjoy writing poems because of how one gets to creatively manage words. While writing a poem, you need to choose the right words, strictly follow the rhyming scheme, maintain the theme & structure of the poem - while simultaneously trying to tell a story through your words. Writing the perfect poem is often tough, but that is what I enjoy.</h4>
                    <h4>Although I have had some of my poems appear in school & college magazines, I have admittedly not been able to write poems as consistently as I wished to, but I try to pursue this skill as much as I can. Hopefully, I can be inspired enough to write poems regularly.</h4>
